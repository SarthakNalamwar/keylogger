# keylogger
Basic Keylogger
This is a simple Python script that can be used to log all keystrokes made on a computer. It uses the pynput library to listen for and record keyboard input.

Usage
To use the keylogger, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the keylogger.py file in a text editor.
Modify the log_file variable to specify the name and location of the log file. By default, the log file is saved in the same directory as the script with the name keylogs.txt.
Save the file and run it using Python 3.
ruby
Copy code
$ python3 keylogger.py
The script will run in the background and record all keystrokes made on the computer. To stop the keylogger, press the ESC key. The log file will contain a record of all keystrokes made while the script was running.
